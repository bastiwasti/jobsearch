# Google — Autonomous Setup Log

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Status**: success

## Task
Set up scraper for Google careers page

## Approach
Dynamic JS with Playwright. Google's careers site is a fully client-side rendered SPA — no job data in initial HTML. Used `?location=Germany&employment_type=FULL_TIME` to pre-filter. Pagination via `&page=N` parameter, 20 results per page.

## Files Created/Modified
- `rules/companies/google.py` — Google scraper class
- `docs/sites/google.md` — site documentation

## Test Results
- Dry run: 45 jobs parsed, 0 matched location filters
- Full run: 45 jobs parsed, 0 stored
- All jobs in Munich/Hamburg/Berlin/Frankfurt (outside Rheinland radius)
- No remote indicators on listing cards
- No errors, no crashes, pagination verified (3 pages, different content)

## Issues & Fixes
- Location spans duplicated in DOM — added dedup logic
- Company text includes Material icon text — hardcoded "Google" instead
- Job URLs include search query params — strip with `url.split("?")[0]`

## Final Status
Working. Scraper correctly parses all 45 German Google jobs. Zero stored because Google's German offices are outside the Rheinland area and remote status isn't available on listing cards. This is expected behavior given the current filter rules.
